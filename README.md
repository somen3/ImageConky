# ImageConky

## ImageConky is a image-only conky that you can use with your regular conky through the Conky Manager. The conky lets you add any image or screenshot to the bottom_right. 

## Installation

- Download ImageConky.zip, and extract the file
- Next, put the extracted dir, ImageConky into the ~/.conky dir
- After that, run your Conky Manager, and select ImageConky from the list
  - If you don't already have Conky Manager installed on your system, you can install it like this:
    - sudo apt install conky-manager
## Usage 

- Using ImageConky is just so simple, and all you have to do is save any image or screenshot as image.png in ~/.conky/ImageConky/

  - Flameshot would be a handy tool to use with this conky
  - Besides, you can even save any wallpaper of your choice to be displayed in the conky; however, you must ensure that you name it as image.png, and save it to ~/.conky/ImageConky/
